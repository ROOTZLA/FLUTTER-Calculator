## Description
This calculator is written in Flutter and allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations:

* addition 
* subtraction
* multiplication 
* division
* percentage 

It has a simple user interface with two screens: the top screen displays user-entered expressions and calculation results, and the bottom screen is a grid of buttons for entering numbers and operators. 

The calculator handles a variety of scenarios, including error handling such as division by zero, and supports a back-to-previous function (ANS button). 

The size of the buttons on the bottom screen automatically adapts to the size of the device's screen, making it easy to use on a variety of devices.
